COPRO-Seq
=========
Scripts and other inputs needed to perform a COPRO-Seq (COmmunity PROfiling by
Sequencing) analysis. This type of analysis is useful when one is interested in
simultaneously measuring the proportional representation of many different
microbes in an experimental sample. It is most appropriate when working with 
defined consortia of known, sequenced organisms.
